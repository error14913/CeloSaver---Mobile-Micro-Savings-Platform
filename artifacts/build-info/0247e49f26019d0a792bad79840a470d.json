The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

@dev Interface of the ERC-20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[ERC-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC-20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by\n presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n ==== Security Considerations\n There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":1198,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1198],"name":"IERC20Permit","nameLocation":"2126:12:9","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"documentation":{"id":1166,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2145:850:9","text":" @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n ordering also apply here.\n Emits an {Approval} event.\n Requirements:\n -

@dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.\n The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract.

Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC-20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all. ==== Security Considerations There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract.

This can easily result in undesired exploitation or bugs, since developers usually assume that overflows raise errors. `SafeCast` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when such an operation overflows. Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.\",\"errors\":{\"SafeCastOverflowedIntDowncast(uint8,int256)\":[{\"details\":\"Value doesn't fit in an int of `bits` size.\"}],\"SafeCastOverflowedIntToUint(int256)\":[{\"details\":\"An int
